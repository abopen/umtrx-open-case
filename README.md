# UmTRX Open Case

![UmTRX open case](/open-case-photo.jpg)

A simple open case for the [UmTRX v2.1](http://umtrx.org/) SDR transceiver.

The design is available in the following formats:

* Corel Draw (source)
* SVG
* PNG
* PDF
* DXF

Note that if using the PDF the only pieces that are required are the two large and two smaller rectangles in the centre of the page.

## Material and cutting

Designed to be laser cut from 3mm clear acrylic.

## Cooling

An [EBM PAPST 405F](http://www.ebmpapst.com/en/products/compact-fans/axial-compact-fans/axial_compact_fans_detail.php?pID=53727) was used, but other 5vdc fans of similar proportions may be suitable. Since the UmTRX fan power output is 6v, a 100 ohm resistor was inserted in-line to drop the voltage.

It may be prudent to add a heatsink to the FPGA also.
